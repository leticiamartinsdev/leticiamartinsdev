Hi, I’m Leticia! 
I'm currently looking for my career transition. 
For me, who used to work with customer service in the hospitality and tourism sector, I am now fully immersed in front-end development. What a turn, no?

- I’m currently learning front-end development and I want to become someone who masters the techniques of HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Python and React.
- I like to be always immersed in new technologies, I really appreciate the area of communication, reading books, series (with a very serious love for Doctor Who), music (seriously, I love Britpop.) and, above all, traveling!
